		but unfortunately there are mine to keep. Don't worry, I still have another category to speak about. In my freshmen year, 
		I joined different organization where I was unexpectedly nominated as a executive board member. They kept and trained me on how to speak 
		and debate appropriately. I'm using it for my further cost on my daily living, especially on my studies which is a fundamental skill to have 
		-- on the modern society, at least. A memorable event occurred when I compete on a debate inter-varsity as a member of this organization which 
		is a hard task to do. But, despite of all circumstances I was able to fight and learn as much as possible that I can use on my further exploration 
		in this society. Moving forward, there are many things that are surprising for each person and I'll gladly tell you mine. 
		One of those is being open-minded when most people are not. Regardless of my religion and family orientation, I keep my own perspective 
		and opinion about life and how to deal with it. Because at first, it is not their life to live. but it's mine -- alone. Surely, 
		they can guarantee to give me guidance that I would need, but the decisions that I would chose is not theirs to make. To end this speech, 
		I'm expecting that our professor would guide us on the fountain of knowledge where information, skills, etc. waits ahead to be drink or sip 
		by her students because learning isn't the professor`s task to do. </p>

            <p>Honestly speaking, I don`t have any favorite application. But, I think it would be similar to “what 
			app caught your interest?” and my answer would be, Google Earth. Knowing that it is expensive to go on a journey, fear not, 
			this application got you covered from different places, tourist spots, as well as other information that can help on your exploration. 
			Aside from that, it also contains details about the location, its distance between you and your destination which is a fundamental thing to 
			have as a traveler. Two months ago, when I installed this application, it’s been my basic source for discovering places where I haven`t 
			visited yet and immerge myself into things that I wanted to see, virtually. Everything in here is essential, from its information regards 
			to real time updates about the current status quo of the place, current events, and tourist destination. We, as a middle-class individual, 
			will surely benefit from this free application given its features and friendly user interface. </p>

            <h3 class="mb-0">Elevator</h3>
            <div class="subheading mb-3">How to design?</div>
            <div>Given this opportunity to construct an exclusive elevator which would cater one thousand floors, I hereby declare my own solution for this task which includes the following details:
					-	Dedicated emergency button and interface
					-	Built-in snack store
					-	Air-conditioned
					-	30 available seats
					-	Air freshener (System base)
					-	Precise Estimated Time of Arrival
					-	Equipped with fast transportation system
					-	Divided into 100 floors (10 elevators) 

					Does these features will greatly benefit the client from its need?
					Assurance is given, due to security system which directly coordinates with the guard/personnel for any in great need of assistance (failure of power supply, stuck on a floor, natural calamities, and the likes). In addition, defense security is equipped for any unexpected external damage which will automatically trigger the system to exceed its structure by fortifying the metals, cables, etc. of the elevator. These equipment are technologically advanced, simply saying they are developed to furtherly reduce the accidents that may occur. Also, on the internal emergencies, there is the interface that directly communicates with the security administration for them to give further assistance and solve any issues that may arise. If the issue wasn’t solved, the security has to instruct users to press the red button to immediately stop the operation of the elevator. This allows the individuals to exit the elevator on a specific floor that ensures the safest route available.
					Moving forward, my next premise will be the cleanliness of the elevators’ air is minutely monitored by the air-vent system which was invented to prevent and eliminate unwanted smell that can cause inconvenience to the users. The system will check if there are any anomalies within the air, if proven it would give warning to the individuals that air freshener will be sprayed within 20 seconds. But, air freshener will also spray the place for every 30 minutes.
					Knowing that there are 1000 floors and it is equally divided to 100 per elevator, the structure also includes selling of snacks inside the elevator to cater the hungry individuals. Employees can pay the product/s through their ID validation using their unique ID number and would be deducted on their salary.
					Last but not least, is the speed of transportation. I, in behalf of my colleagues, would like present the future of elevators, “The Mayt”. This system allows to greatly reduce the time spent by the employees on waiting for their destination. How? System, will teleport the elevator on the in queue floors. But, there will be specific range of floors that can only be teleported to. For example, if you are on floor 13 and you’ll go to floor 15 in between no individuals pressed the button for the elevator on floor 14 then you’ll be regularly transported without teleportation. If you were on floor 30 and pressed floor 50 which there were no individuals pressed the button in between 31 and 49 you’ll be automatically teleported. These are the conditions, simply saying there are regular and teleport system that will be implemented.

            <p>That's how you design, boy.</p>

		<p> Problem:
				In the current status quo of our society, people have the capability to think of travelling on places they haven`t visited yet. They are enticed with the beautiful views of nature along with its different activities and events to begin with. People are always looking forward on creating unforgettable moments, experiences and memories with or without their love ones.
				Searching different places for possible vacation would be easy due to today`s technology but, the problem begins when there are varieties of information on the internet and people are confused because when these are compared on each other it produces unmatched result.

				Needs:
				•	A travel guide that contains information about different tourist’s spot, restaurant, do’s and don’ts, etiquettes, and basic language of a certain country.
				•	Gathered precise information as a guidance on travelling to different places.

		improve these things, I can assure that USERDES will be able to furtherly enhance my thinking capability to exert interesting design

            <p>Within the past week, we’ve discussed about the importance and the potential threat of not having a specific goal for your project. This would lead you unto unknown path which you can no longer find your way to progress and time was wasted. Due to these circumstances, we, as a team, can clearly state that the lack of visualization, characterization, and information leads to a failed project. But, hang on, we've also prevented and took precautions to avoid any unnecessary mistakes as we thoroughly progress and critically think about our next steps, goals perhaps.
I’ve gathered different ideas from other groups such as, who will be our target market, what lacks on the application, can you still cope-up on the demand of its service, etc. which will be a great catalyst for us to furtherly understand our problem and stand with our conviction. Knowing that there is no perfect application cease to exist, we will keep on providing features and updates that will cover the want/s or need/s of the society by continuously consolidating on our target market as well as seeking help to those who are already professional in this particular matter.
As an I.T student, who’s looking forward to acquire more knowledge, skills, and solutions for the benefit of the society, I must say that we can not answer a question if we do not know the problem and that is why, it is important to explore the societies need/s or want/s or even predict the technology beyond our comprehension. Because we are humans, and we have unlimited time to progress and exceed the worlds’ limitation. That being said, I shall comply to the requirements of the professor and continue to inspire my colleagues as well as our predecessors.

            <p> In this particular period, I've learned that there are other ways that we can upload our file and create a storage where both end-user and creator can communicate with. It’s easy to say that a form of communication can be brought up to different medium within the technological advancement where people can update it anytime with a simple push and commit button. In addition, you can clearly navigate the whereabouts of your file on this particular storage called “repository” which significantly helped students to maintain a stable connection with their respective professor. Not only that we can use github for this matter, but heroku as well which mainly focuses on linking the mainstream file coming from github on its own server by linking in.
Both web application provided the “security” for any threat/s coming from different malware, ransomware, viruses, etc. that greatly affect the file of the end-user to its recipient. I don’t have to elaborate more than what I needed to due to the fact that this is what I’ve learned for this week.

            <p>Throughout the 2 days of discussion, I, along with my team, have learned that different experiences can lead to insignificant or significant result of a certain project. But, this doesn’t stop here due to the fact that we also have to cater the preferences of the users which is seemly impossible since each person has it’s own kind of perspective for a particular application. This is what we have to provide solution with, to ponder the need/s or want/s of our target audience which should incline on our objective because if we failed to produce the quality of interface users expected to, well its safe to say that you already lost the competition as well as your time.
We can probably say that a minimalistic, yet precise user interface without exaggerated variables would suffice the audience interest to test our application. It just has to be designed relatively to the main goal of the application, for example our objective would be to create an application which correlates the different places in luzon. Given this scenario we should not include places for visayas and mindanao because it’s not necessary, same with the user interface.
I hereby end my reflection, there are no longer information that I can reflect with. But, it set as an high importance to produce a good quality of UI which users can easily interact and interpret the features of this app.
